This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that relies on a value from a state variable.  If the state variable changes, the function is recreated, even if its dependencies haven't changed, causing unexpected behavior and potentially breaking component functionality. This is usually subtle and hard to debug because the function reference changes, but the function's internal logic remains unchanged. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Correct dependency array

  // This is the buggy code - missing the count in the dependency array causing issues
  const buggyIncrement = useCallback(()=>{
    setCount(prevCount=>prevCount+1)
  },[]) 

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
      <Button title="Buggy Increment" onPress={buggyIncrement} />
    </View>
  );
};

```
